IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, fan and critical reviews, and ratings. An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon. By late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000 movies and television series correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On October 17, 1990, Needham developed and posted a collection of Unix shell scripts which could be used to search the four lists, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born.At the time, it was known as the rec.arts.movies movie database. Internet Movie Database users are invited to participate in the site's ever-growing wealth of information by rating movies on a rating scale. The labeled dataset consists of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews. No individual movie has more than 30 reviews. The 25,000 reviews labeled training set does not include any of the same movies as the 25,000 review test set.
